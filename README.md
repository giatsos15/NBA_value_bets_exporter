# Here I will upload my analyses and thoughts on the management of statistics

In the nba notebook is the scrapping of stats and in stoiximan the scrapping of handicap. Maybe later we'll add the odds for calculating jersey percentages.

The results file is where the stats are compared, the last few games compared to the overall stats of the players. In it we will logically put the handicaps and the odds for calculating value bets.
